 21/01/16 – N512:  First lecture and meeting of the team, introduced to the task and began to assign the important roles amongst ourselves. We then established means of contacting each other in order for the team to arrange meetings and exchange other important information outside of scheduled hours. During this session we discussed goals to be completed, ready for the next meeting, which consisted of thinking of a company name, setting up Xamarin (to be used in the project) and thinking of an idea for an android application. (Start: 16:49. End: 18:00. 71 minutes)

 25/01/16 – B201: The team and I met in the labs in order to discuss our ideas for the android application, some examples included a 'drinking game encyclopedia', 'learn programming 	application'  and a 'random bicycle ride trip planner'. During this meeting we also set up a communal company e-mail/dropbox account to use in online storage and thus furthering our	communication. We settled for the random bike ride planner and then decided to think of features for this application to discuss next meeting. (Start: 14:03. End: 14:26. 23 	Minutes)
